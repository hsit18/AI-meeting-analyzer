Benefits and Challenges of Public Cloud Adoption (80% Participation)

Rahul: Now, let's discuss the benefits and challenges of adopting public cloud solutions. Who would like to start?

Sneha: Sorry to interrupt, but while public cloud is fascinating, I wonder how private cloud solutions compare, especially regarding data control and compliance.

Ankit: That's a valid point, Sneha. Private cloud solutions indeed offer greater control over sensitive data and compliance requirements.

Neha: However, they might lack the scalability and cost advantages of public cloud solutions.

Rahul: Sneha, Ankit, Neha, thank you for highlighting the importance of considering private cloud options. Let's continue with our comparison discussion.

Rahul: Unfortunately, we're running out of time. I suggest we continue this discussion in smaller groups to explore specific use cases and action items. We'll reconvene next week to share our findings.
