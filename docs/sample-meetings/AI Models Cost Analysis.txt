**Meeting Moderator (Ananya):** Good morning, everyone. Let's begin our meeting on the New AI Transformation team. Today, we have three agenda items to discuss. Firstly, I'd like to open the floor for any insights or thoughts on large language models.

**Ravi Deshmukh (Pune):** Thank you, Ananya. Large language models have been instrumental in transforming natural language processing tasks. We've seen significant progress, particularly with models like GPT-3.

**Amit Kumar (Hyderabad):** I agree, Ravi. However, we must also consider the computational resources required to train and deploy these models, especially in production environments.

**Kavita Reddy (Hyderabad):** Absolutely, Amit. The infrastructure costs associated with running LLMs at scale can be substantial. We need to explore strategies for optimizing resource utilization without compromising performance.

**Neha Singh (Hyderabad):** Building on that point, we should also discuss the feasibility of deploying nano models on local computers. It could offer more flexibility and potentially reduce dependency on cloud resources.

**Sanjay Gupta (Pune):** I see the value in exploring nano models, Neha. However, we must ensure that they maintain adequate performance levels for various applications. Compatibility and efficiency will be critical factors to consider.

**Rajesh Patel (Pune):** Moving on to our third agenda item, the cost implications of utilizing large language models. It's crucial to conduct a thorough analysis of the expenses involved, including licensing fees, infrastructure, and maintenance costs.

**Priya Sharma (Hyderabad):** I completely agree, Rajesh. Cost transparency is essential for effective budget planning and resource allocation within our team and organization.

**Ananya Sharma (Moderator):** Thank you all for your valuable insights on our agenda items. Before we conclude, does anyone have any additional points to raise or any off-topic discussions they'd like to address?

**(Silence for a moment)**

**Ananya Sharma (Moderator):** It seems we've covered our agenda thoroughly today. If there are no further comments, let's adjourn the meeting. Thank you all for your active participation and contributions.

**(Meeting concludes at 10:15 AM)**
